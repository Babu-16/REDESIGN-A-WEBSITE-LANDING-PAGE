*DESCRIPTION:  We redesigned Spotify with the goal of creating a more modern, immersive, and emotionally engaging experience for users. The original layout, while functional, felt a bit static and visually crowded, especially on desktop. So we took inspiration from Apple’s clean and fluid design language, giving the interface a more premium and breathable look. We introduced dynamic elements like a particle background and ripple cursor interaction to reflect the rhythm and energy of music, making the platform feel more alive. Buttons were redesigned with smooth hover transitions and responsive feedback to improve usability and bring a sense of motion to every click. We also used soft yet bold color schemes, updated typography, and simplified iconography to make everything feel intuitive and easy on the eyes. Overall, the redesign brings a balance of style and function — turning Spotify from just a music player into a more personal and interactive experience.
